  <description>FastCanvas is a PhoneGap plugin which implements a very fast, 2D, mostly-HTML5-canvas-compatible rendering surface for Android. 
    On other platforms, it silently falls back on the native Canvas implementation.
    While FastCanvas attempts to look and behave like the HTML5 canvas, it only supports a subset of the HTML5 canvas API, focusing on what benefits most from hardware acceleration.
